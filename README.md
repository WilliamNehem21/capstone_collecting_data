## Food Classification Model using TensorFlow

This project aims to develop a classification model for detecting various types of food using TensorFlow. The dataset comprises images of junk food obtained through web scraping from Google. 

The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify different types of junk food, enabling applications in dietary analysis, health monitoring, and food recognition systems.


# Note :
### For the Junkfood Classification Final Model, it's in the Master branch
